## InstaBot

InstaBot is a python script that can watch public instagram profiles for new posts and sends notifications to a telegram channel. Uses the official Bot API by Telegram and the official API by Instagram!

### Channel

Enter a channel that you (and your bot) have access to in the form of "channel_id" or "\@channelname".

### API Token

Enter the API Token for your Telegram bot.

### Runtime

Enter the time in seconds how long the bot should run. Has to be an integer number. If set 0 the bot will run until exiting the application!

### Story Notification Time

Enter the time when the bot should send story notifications. Has to be an integer in the range of 0 <= time < 24.

### User IDs

Enter the user IDs of the instagram accounts your bot should watch. You can enter multiple user IDs by seperating them with a semicolon (";").

### Debugging Mode

If checked it will send more notifications to your channel to observe the state of the bot.

### Start InstaBot!

Starts the bot. All parameters have to be set beforehand!

### Status Bar

The following states are possible:

- Waiting...: Waiting for inputs!
- Running...: The bot is running!
- Finished!: The bot is finished!

## InstaView

Transforms Instagram's data - that you get via the [Data Download Tool](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-download-all-your-instagram-data/) - to a readable format!

### Absolute Path

Enter the absolute path to your data directory!

This directory should roughly have this structure:

- direct [folder]
- photos [folder]
- profile [folder]
- stories [folder]
- videos [folder]
- comments.json
- connections.json
- contacts.json
- likes.json
- media.json
- messages.json
- profile.json
- searches.json
- settings.json


### Knit PDF!

Creates the RMD in the specified directory with name "instaview.Rmd" and tries to knit it to a PDF file. This action is only successful if "R", "knitr" and all dependencies are correctly installed.

You can still manually knit the RMD file if knitting was unsuccesful. For that go to your data directory and run the following in "R":

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(rmarkdown)
render("instaview.Rmd")
```

It is highly recommended to use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) for that!

### Status Bar

The status bar will display when the process is finished!

## Results

This page displays results that are multiline!

### Load Results!

Load results from the most recent query!
